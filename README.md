# Customer Information File (CIF)
## What Is a Customer Information File (CIF)?
A customer information file (CIF) is an electronic file that stores all pertinent information about a customer's personal and account information. The customer information file (CIF), which contains a CIF number, allows the business to view its customer accounts by relationship and not strictly by account type. Although many industries have customer files, CIFs have been traditionally associated with the banking industry. A CIF at a bank might include a client's credit relationships, accounts owned, and ownership information.

## How a Customer Information File (CIF) Works
The CIF for bank records such information as a customer's vital statistics account balances and transactions, and types of accounts held. It is updated as often as daily to ensure accuracy and is used to assist in various service and administrative functions.

A CIF provides the business with a summary of all of the activities associated with a particular customer. A CIF is more commonly held in an electronic format today along with its CIF number. However, a CIF paper folder often exists as well containing relevant documents such as signature cards used during the account opening process. The customer information file functions as a central point for examining customer data without having to look up each account or transaction individually.

Commercial banking uses CIFs to show the various credit products such as business loans and credit cards currently in use by a customer. The CIF may also display information regarding any previous inquiries, to help provide targeted information for the purpose of cross-selling, which is offering complementary products to existing clients.
